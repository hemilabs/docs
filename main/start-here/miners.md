* What is [Proof-of-Proof](../../foundational-topics/the-architecture/proof-of-proof/) (PoP)?
* Learn about [PoP Consensus and Bitcoin Finality](../../foundational-topics/the-architecture/proof-of-proof/pop-consensus-and-bitcoin-finality.md)
* An overview of [PoP mining](../../foundational-topics/the-architecture/proof-of-proof/pop-mining.md) and [mining rewards](../../foundational-topics/the-architecture/proof-of-proof/pop-mining.md)

***

### 2️⃣ Set Up Your Wallets

Prepare your various wallets to start PoP mining on Hemi by setting up an EVM and BTC wallet.&#x20;

* \[_Optional_] [Set up an EVM wallet ](../../how-to-tutorials/using-hemi/wallet-setup/metamask-wallet-setup.md)(MetaMask) and [connect to Hemi](../network-details.md)
