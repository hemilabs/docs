### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Mining

There are two primary methods to run a PoP miner within the Hemi Network:

* [**CLI Version:**](https://docs.hemi.xyz/how-to-tutorials/pop-mining/setup-part-1) The CLI (Command Line Interface) version is designed for long-term, continuous operation, requires some technical knowledge but provides robust security and operational efficiency.&#x20;
* [**Web-based Miner:**](../../how-to-tutorials/using-hemi/pop-mining/web-based-pop-miner.md) The web-based PoP miner is lightweight, user-friendly, and requires no special hardware, ideal for users of all experience levels to test and run their own PoP miner.
