## ✈️ Welcome to the Hemi Pilot Program

If you're here, you're in the perfect place at the perfect time!

Welcome to the Hemi community, where builders and crypto enthusiasts come together to shape the future of web3. We believe in being community-first—building together for a collective goal that's more powerful than individual ambitions.

We offer something for everyone (beginner, intermediate, advanced) for both on-chain and off-chain activities.

***

## &#x20;⚡ How?&#x20;

&#x20;Here's how you can earn "Miles" and rise through the ranks:

* **💻 On-chain Activities:** Deploying Smart Contracts, interacting with Hemi Hatchlings, Tunneling.
* 🔧 **Technical Activities**: Participating in code reviews, proposing feature improvements, writing tutorials, explanations, or documentation.
* **🎨 Creative Projects:** Entering contests (TBA), designing new Hemi Hatchlings, suggesting and improving UX (for Hemi dApps ).
* **🔗 Community Building:** Hosting in-person events or online education sessions, joining Discord, or participating in AMAs.
* **🎉 Social Events:** Hosting and attending happy hours and meetups, hosting Twitter Spaces or online discussions with experts.

## 🏅Ranks

Ranks are cool badges you earn by collecting miles (points) and reaching specific tier thresholds.

You can earn miles from all sorts of activities, from deploying smart contracts and running PoP miners to hosting Twitter Spaces or IRL events. We've got something for everyone with both on-chain and off-chain activities.&#x20;

**There are 6 ranks:**

1. **Cadet**
2. **Navigator**
3. **Lieutenant**
4. **Commander**
5. **Major**
6. **Captain**

**🔓 **_**Captain is the rank you want to aim for!**_&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The tier threshold for each rank will be announced in mid-August.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. The[ incentivized testnet and referral program](http://dashboard.hemi.xyz) are accessible today, and you can earn "M**iles"** (points).&#x20;
2. Any activities you complete during this period (with a corresponding miles reward) will be counted towards your miles total. If you’ve been doing this for a while, you can take a pretty good guess as to what those activities tend to be.&#x20;
3. The leaderboard launches in early August. On that day, you’ll see the leaderboard rankings and, retroactively, how well you did in that first week.&#x20;
4. From there, earn away!
