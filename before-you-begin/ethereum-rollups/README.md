# Ethereum Rollups

{% hint style="info" %}
## 📜 **TL;DR:**

* 🚗 Rollups optimize Ethereum's performance by gathering transactions "off the main Ethereum highway" (Layer 1) and then officially process them on the "side road" **(Layer 2).**

## 🌐 Overview

* Ethereum Rollups are a Layer 2 scaling solution designed to enhance the _**throughput and features**_ of the Ethereum network.
* They operate by "rolling up" or bundling multiple transactions off-chain, and submitting them in batches to the Ethereum mainnet for data-availability. By doing so, they significantly reduce congestion and gas fees while maintaining interoperability with Ethereum.
* Rollups can also add new protocol features that would be impossible directly on Ethereum, for example PoP security to inherit Bitcoin Finality and Hemi's hVM Bitcoin Interoperability system.
