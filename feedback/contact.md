### Security Vulnerabilities

If you've found a security vulnerability in Hemi, we want to hear about it.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Do not** test against production systems, disclose vulnerabilities publicly, or report them in GitHub issues. Doing so puts users at risk, may violate applicable law, and will disqualify you from rewards.\
\
Denial-of-service testing, social engineering, and volumetric attacks are explicitly out of scope and prohibited. **All security research must be conducted in accordance with the policies outlined in our** [**Bugcrowd program**](https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/hemi)**.**
{% endhint %}

#### How to Report

All vulnerability reports **must** be submitted through our official [Vulnerability Disclosure Program on Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/hemi). We do not accept vulnerability reports via email, Discord, social media, or any other channel. Reports submitted outside of Bugcrowd will not be reviewed or eligible for rewards.

When reporting, the more information you can provide, the faster we can triage and confirm the vulnerability. Reports with clear reproduction steps and screenshots are highly valued.

#### Bug Bounty Program

Hemi also operates a private Bug Bounty program on Bugcrowd with paid rewards. Researchers who submit high-quality reports through our Vulnerability Disclosure Program may be invited to participate at Hemi's discretion.

#### Responsible Disclosure

Please do not discuss any vulnerabilities outside our Bugcrowd program without express consent from Hemi Labs. Follow our [program disclosure policy](https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/hemi) for full details.

Hemi provides Safe Harbor for security research conducted in good faith under our program policy. See the full Safe Harbor terms on our [Bugcrowd program page](https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/hemi).
