# Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
## 📜 **TL;DR:**

* The **Hemi Network** is a modular Layer-2 protocol for superior scaling, security, and interoperability, powered by Bitcoin and Ethereum.
* Whereas other projects approach Bitcoin and Ethereum as ecosystem silos, Hemi views them as components of a single supernetwork. This unlocks new levels of programmability, portability, and potential.
* At Hemi's core: the **Hemi Virtual Machine (hVM)**, which incorporates a full Bitcoin node within an **Ethereum Virtual Machine**.
* Combined with the **Hemi Bitcoin Kit (hBK)**, developers have a familiar yet powerful platform for creating Hemi decentralized applications (hApps).

## 🌐 Overview

* The **Hemi Network** represents a different way of thinking about Layer-2 scaling, by approaching **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** as components of a supernetwork versus .
* This modular protocol aims to scale these networks and maximize their utility, creating a more connected and efficient blockchain ecosystem.
* Through features such as the **hVM**, Hemi equips developers with robust tools for building next-generation **dApps** with Bitcoin _and_ Ethereum interoperability.

## 💡 The Benefits of Hemi

{% hint style="success" %}
*   **Ease of Development**

    The Hemi Virtual Machine (hVM) integrates a full Bitcoin node within an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), providing developers with a familiar programming interface while harnessing the power of both Bitcoin and Ethereum.
*   **Bitcoin Programmability**

    Building with the Hemi Bitcoin Kit (hBK) provides smart contracts with highly granular indexed views of Bitcoin state, unlocking Bitcoin DeFi applications were previously impractical or impossible to execute via an EVM.
*   **Bitcoin Superfinality**

    Hemi's **Proof-of-Proof (PoP)** consensus mechanism ensures transactions surpass Bitcoin's level of security in just a few hours.
*   **Trustless Cross-chain Portability**

    The hVM's unique awareness of Bitcoin's and Ethereum's states enables secure, seamless asset transfers between Hemi and other chains through its "Tunnels" feature.
*   **Extensibility**

    Hemi allows external projects to create their own chains secured by Hemi's technology, facilitating Bitcoin-Security-as-a-Service and enhancing dual-chain interoperability.
*   **Superior Asset Handling**

    Advanced on-chain functionalities, including routing, time-lock, and password protection, are made possible through Hemi, elevating asset management and security.
