{% hint style="info" %}

## 🔄 Why Use a Third-Party Bridge?

Hemi’s native Tunnel supports tunneling BTC, however, some assets (e.g., pumpBTC, iBTC) are not yet integrated. In these cases, a third-party bridge provides:

• Fast bridging times.

• Established track record of security and reliability.

• Wide token support.
