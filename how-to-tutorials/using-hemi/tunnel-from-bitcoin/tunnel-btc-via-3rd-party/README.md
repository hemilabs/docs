# Tunnel BTC via 3rd Party

{% hint style="info" %}
## 📜 **TL;DR:**

* Certain tokens are not yet supported by Hemi’s native Tunnel.&#x20;
* For these assets, you can use one of several third-party tunnel solutions to move tokens between Bitcoin and Hemi.

## 🔄 Why Use a Third-Party Bridge?

Hemi’s native Tunnel supports tunneling BTC, however, some assets (e.g., pumpBTC, iBTC) are not yet integrated. In these cases, a third-party bridge provides:

• Fast bridging times.

• Established track record of security and reliability.

• Wide token support.

## 🤝 Supported Third-Party Bridges

Below is a list of third-party bridges you can use to transfer BTC assets to Hemi. Each bridge has its own UI, fees, and specific token support.&#x20;
