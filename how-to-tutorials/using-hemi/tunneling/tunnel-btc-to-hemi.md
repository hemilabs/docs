# Tunnel BTC via Native Tunnel



{% hint style="info" %}
## üìú **TL;DR:**

* Move your BTC to Hemi by using the Bitcoin Tunnel, enabling interactions within the Hemi Network ecosystem with Bitcoin assets.
* An [EVM](../../tutorials/metamask-wallet-setup.md) and [BTC](../wallet-setup/btc-wallet-setup/) wallet are required to move BTC assets via the Bitcoin Tunnel.
{% endhint %}

***

## üèÅ Prerequisites

* **Acquire BTC** - BTC can be purchased on any number of exchanges and on-ramps.&#x20;
* [**EVM (MetaMask) Wallet Setup**](../../tutorials/metamask-wallet-setup.md) **-** Set up your EVM wallet and add the Hemi Network.
* [**BTC Wallet Setup**](../wallet-setup/btc-wallet-setup/) **-** Set up your BTC wallet.

**TESTNET ONLY**\

If you plan on developing on or interacting with Hemi testnet, alternative prerequisites may apply. To test out the Bitcoin Tunnel on testnet, you can obtain tBTC (Testnet Bitcoin) via [**Direct Faucet Access**](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/)**.**
