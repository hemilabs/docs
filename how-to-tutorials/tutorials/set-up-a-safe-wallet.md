### 3. Name your Safe

After connecting your wallet, you will be prompted to name your Safe account.&#x20;

### 4. Add signers and assign a threshold

A Safe Wallet can be set up as a multi-sig wallet, whitelisting addresses who may sign transactions on behalf of the wallet. You may assign a name to each address you intend to add to the wallet.  &#x20;

After adding additional signers, you may specify how many signers are required to sign any given transaction. This variable is referred to as the Threshold. \
