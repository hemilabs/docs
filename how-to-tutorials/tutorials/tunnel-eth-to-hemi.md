# Tunnel ETH to Hemi

{% hint style="info" %}
## 📜 **TL;DR:**

* Acquire`ETH`, which is essential for initiating transactions and testing smart contracts on Hemi testnet.
* Move your ETH to Hemi by using the Tunnel, enabling interactions within the Hemi Network ecosystem.
{% endhint %}

***

## 🏁 Prerequisites

* **Acquire ETH** - ETH can be purchased on any number of exchanges and on-ramps. Hemi is currently integrated with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) and we recommend MetaMask to purchase your ETH for the quickest onboarding. You may also visit other exchanges, such as Coinbase, to purchase and send your ETH to MetaMask.
* [**EVM (MetaMask) Wallet Setup**](metamask-wallet-setup.md) **-** Set up your EVM wallet and add the Hemi Network before interacting with any Hemi application.

{% hint style="info" %}
**TESTNET ONLY**\
\
If you plan on developing on or interacting with Hemi testnet, alternative prerequisites may apply:

* To test out the Tunnel on the Sepolia testnet, you can obtain Sepolia ETH with any of the following options:
  1. [**Hemi Discord Faucet**](https://discord.gg/hemixyz): Join our Discord and tap our Hemi Sepolia ETH faucet!
  2. [**Using Alchemy**](https://sepoliafaucet.com/): This method requires creating an account but is generally **faster**.
  3. [**Direct Faucet Access**](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de): If you prefer a no-account option, though it might be **slower**, use the Sepolia Faucet directly.
* Learn how to [connect to the Sepolia network](../../main/start-here/developers.md).
