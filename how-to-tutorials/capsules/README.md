## 📜 TL;DR:

* The Hemi Onboarding Capsule gives you all the testnet tokens (tBTC, ETH, and tHEMI) you need to start building and using Hemi. These are gasless transactions that can be used for everything.
* When you claim your onboarding capsule, you get everything you need to mine PoP, pay transaction fees, and use the Hemi Tunnel.
* Only one onboarding capsule may be claimed per user.

## 💊 Capsule Details

A further look into what's in your Capsule and how you can use it:

* **ETH (Sepolia):**
  * Sepolia Ether acquired from your Capsule can be tunneled (bridged) and used to interact with and build dApps on Hemi by paying transaction fees.
* **tBTC:**
  * tBTC is essential to run a PoP miner.
  * In the future, you can tunnel your tBTC (and other Bitcoin assets) to Hemi for use in Bitcoin DeFi deployed on Hemi.
* **tHemi:**
  * **tHEMI** is the governance token for the Hemi Network's testnet phase.
  * **tHEMI tokens are used for payouts** to PoP miners as a means of acknowledging their contribution to the network's security and functionality. In the future, these incentives will expand to individuals running Sequencers, Publishers, and Challengers.
