## 💊 Capsule Details

A further look into what's in your Capsule and how you can use it:

* **ETH (Sepolia):**
  * Sepolia Ether acquired from your Capsule can be tunneled (bridged) and used to interact with and build dApps on Hemi by paying transaction fees.
* **tBTC:**
  * tBTC is essential to run a PoP miner.
  * In the future, you can tunnel your tBTC (and other Bitcoin assets) to Hemi for use in Bitcoin DeFi deployed on Hemi.
* **tHemi:**
  * **tHEMI** is the governance token for the Hemi Network's testnet phase.
  * **tHEMI tokens are used for payouts** to PoP miners as a means of acknowledging their contribution to the network's security and functionality. In the future, these incentives will expand to individuals running Sequencers, Publishers, and Challengers.
