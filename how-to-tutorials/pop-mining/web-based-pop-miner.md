# Web-based PoP Miner

{% hint style="info" %}
## 📜 **TL;DR:**

* In this tutorial, we will run a [web-based PoP Miner](https://pop-miner.hemi.xyz).
* The web-based PoP miner is designed for ease of use, allowing users of all experience levels to test and run their own PoP miner.&#x20;
* We recommend storing only a **limited amount of working funds** in the wallet associated with the web-based miner.&#x20;
* The web-based PoP miner includes a helpful dashboard for viewing the latest transactions/publications, including their status and cost.

## 🌐 Overview

* The web-based PoP miner is designed for ease of use, allowing users of all experience levels to test and run their own PoP miner. Due to its lightweight nature, there are no specific hardware requirements, making it accessible from any standard computer.&#x20;
* While it is not intended for long-term mining operations, it serves as an excellent entry point for users interested in transitioning to the more durable CLI version, providing an introduction to Hemi's architecture and its unique integration with the Bitcoin network.

***

## 🔐 Security Note

* The web-based miner uses the same secure code as the CLI miner, however, it also relies on your web browser, which introduces additional security risks. Therefore, we recommend storing only a **limited amount of working funds** in the wallet associated with the web-based miner. For long-term use, consider using the CLI miner.
* When transitioning to the CLI PoP Miner, it is recommended to generate a new public key. Private key information obtained via the web-based PoP Miner, although encrypted, is not fully secure and is not meant for extended mining operations.&#x20;

## 📚 Tutorial

### **1. Access the Web-Based Miner**

* Navigate to the [PoP miner web interface](https://pop-miner.hemi.xyz).

### **2. Generate or Input Private Key**

* **Generate a Private Key:** Click on the option to generate a new private key. This key will be used for your PoP mining activities.
* **Input Existing Private Key:** If you already have a private key, select this option and input your key to proceed.

### **3. Fund your Bitcoin Address**

* Fund your Bitcoin address, provided in-screen, to pay for gas required during PoP mining.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You can also find the estimated mining costs in Bitcoin (tBTC) for different time periods. Please ensure you transfer at least `0.002 tBTC` to the provided address to start PoP mining.

## 👀 Monitoring Your Mining

* The dashboard displays your tHEMI and tBTC balances. A tBTC balance is required to pay for gas fees published to the Bitcoin network. tHEMI is rewarded to addresses running a PoP node for participating in and securing the Hemi Network.
* The web-based PoP miner includes a helpful dashboard for viewing the latest transactions/publications, including their status and cost.

***

## ⭐️ Best Practices

* Use the web-based miner for short-term testing and experimentation.
* For prolonged mining operations, consider transitioning to the [CLI version](https://docs.hemi.xyz/how-to-tutorials/pop-mining/setup-part-1).

***

## 🎬 Conclusion

* The web-based PoP miner is a user-friendly and accessible way to explore PoP mining on the Hemi Network.&#x20;
* It offers a straightforward path for users to understand and participate in mining activities, serving as a gateway to more advanced mining options.
