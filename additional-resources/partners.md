## Review Process

Once your submission is received, our team will review it within 2 business days. We take every inquiry seriously and evaluate each on its merits.&#x20;

* **If You Don't Hear From Us:** Should 2 business days pass without a response, it might indicate that your proposal isn't the right fit for us at the moment. This doesn't reflect your proposal's value; rather, it might not align with our current needs or focus areas.
* **Encouragement to Reapply**: We understand circumstances and offerings evolve. If you're still interested, please consider reapplying in 2-4 weeks. Your future proposals might align better with our changing needs.&#x20;
* **If Your Inquiry Matches Our Needs:** For inquiries that align with our goals and capabilities, expect to hear from us within the specified review period. We're excited about partnering with entities that complement our mission and enhance our offerings.&#x20;
