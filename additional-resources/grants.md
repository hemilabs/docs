# Grants

## 🏁 Getting Started

Are you building the next killer Hemi application (hApp) or a service that adds value to Hemi's ecosystem? Fill out the form below to let us know what you're building and apply for a grant!

Want some inspiration? Check out the lists below for some of the projects we're most excited about.&#x20;

If you don't see your idea on this list, we'd still love to hear what you're interested in building!&#x20;

## 🤖 Bitcoin-Aware hApps (Using hVM or hBK)

These are hApps that directly take advantage of Hemi's EVM-level Bitcoin awareness.

* Non-Custodial BTC / BTC Asset DEXes
  * A decentralized exchange to trade Bitcoin or Bitcoin-based assets without requiring users to give up custody of their funds.&#x20;
* Non-Custodial Bitcoin Lending
  * A dApp to enable Bitcoin-based lending (either borrowing Bitcoin itself or using Bitcoin as collateral for other loans) without users giving up custody of their funds.&#x20;
* Bitcoin "smart wallets" with custom key manager sets
  * Users/smart contracts create Bitcoin wallets controlled by configurable validator sets and managed on Hemi; smart wallet owners can specify transactions that should be performed on Bitcoin from their wallet, and validators work together to sign and propagate on Bitcoin
* Bitcoin "transaction forwarding"
  * A dApp where users/smart contracts can send tunneled BTC on Hemi to a liquidity provider, who then sends tunneled BTC to the sender’s specified destination.
* Bitcoin MEV Marketplace / Tx Accelerator
  * A dApp where users can submit raw Bitcoin transactions or their hashes along with an attached reward (in $HEMI, $ETH, etc.), which will be paid out to the Bitcoin miner that includes their specified Bitcoin transaction in a block
* Ordinals/Inscriptions "minting-as-a-service"
  * A service that facilitates the creation of Ordinals.&#x20;
* Any other novel Bitcoin dApp that benefits from introspection into Bitcoin data

## ✨ Artificial Intelligence hApps

These are hApps that utilize AI directly or provide services that AI developers want to use.

* ZK-Verified MLaaS (ML as a Service)
  * Model owners authenticate their private models to Bitcoin via Hemi by publishing a hash of the model weights. Consumers select a model and send data to perform inference on, and the model owner computes the requested inference and returns the result along with a zero-knowledge proof demonstrating correct execution against the specified model.
* Private FHE-based MLaaS
  * Similar to zk-verified MLaaS, but the model consumers send fully homomorphically encrypted input data, meaning the model owner can't see the consumer's data they are performing inference with.
* Training Data Marketplace
  * Marketplace for users to buy and sell the rights to use different data sets for model training, producing a proof of data licensing authenticated to Bitcoin via Hemi. Optionally, ZK-verified training proofs could be employed to cryptographically prove that a model was only trained on licensed data.
* Decentralized Machine Learning
  * Peer-to-peer marketplaces for buying computing power. Could either be generic compute purchasing, or AI-specific distributed training/inference protocols.
* Portfolio Management Agents and DAOs
  * Autonomous AI agents that trade assets or perform other on-chain actions on Hemi for a user or group of users.
* Crowd-Sourced Data Classification
  * Humans perform data classification/labeling on data so it can be used for machine learning, and are paid a reward if their classification is aligned with the majority of other users.&#x20;
