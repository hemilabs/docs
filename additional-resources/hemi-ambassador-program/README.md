## 🔎 What Does Hemi Look For?

* First ingredient: passion! We believe that enthusiasm goes a long way and we encourage and support Web3 enthusiasts. The main ideas are to promote the Hemi environment, provide feedback to the Hemi team, connect and invite other enthusiasts to the community, assist users with questions and technical support, create content and ultimately join us at our live events!
* Whether you are a builder or an enthusiast, we are happy to find a place for you in our Ambassador Program:
  * **🎙️ Engagement:** Connecting with us and other users is the cornerstone of any community. Initiate thought-provoking conversations with community members, create content (yes, memes too!), organize events, assist others and provide feedback to the Hemi team.
  * **🗣️ Advocacy:** Share your knowledge and experience with other Web3 enthusiasts and builders, be a point of contact for users and direct them to the docs or other resources they may need.
  * **🧐 Research:** By being present in these communities, you have access to unique insights with pain points, trends and ideas. These valuable insights help us strengthen the Hemi brand and user experience.
  * **📚 Educator:** By being an extension of Hemi, you’re given the opportunity to create educational content, host events and potentially join us for our live events globally\*.
